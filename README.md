# coding-challenges
This repository that displays any coding challenges I have worked through in my spare time. I have commented code to demonstrate my thought process and modeled my process for others' viewing. Where I am unfamiliar with a language, I have attempted the challenge anyway, to deepen my understanding of wider concepts. Should my solutions leave an impression, please reach out to discuss working together or just to get in touch!
